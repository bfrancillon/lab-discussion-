OSCC is an assemblage of software and hardware designs that enable computer control of modern cars in order to facilitate the development of autonomous vehicle technology.It is a modular and stable way of using software to interface with a vehicleâ€™s communications network and control systems.While all OSCC modules have operator override detection enabled by default, attempting to grab the steering wheel while the system is active could result in serious injury.
